Hello User of my Repository.

You landed on the repository for LiquidHarvester.
LiquidHarvester is a plugin for HonorBuddy, a World of Warcraft bot.
This is a trivial little addon that harvests corpses after looting them (e.g Minable, Herbable and Salvagable corpses).

Whenever you loot a corpse that is harvestable, LiquidHarvester will kick in and harvest the corpse for resources.
This way get more value out of your profession.

Any bugs? Report em on the forums in the LiquidHarvester topic.

Thanks, LiquidAtoR.
